# SF-Salaries

One way to understand how a city government works is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. This data contains the names, job title, and compensation for San Francisco city employees on an annual basis from 2011 to 2014.

## Exploration Ideas

To help get you started, here are some data exploration ideas:

How have salaries changed over time between different groups of people?
How are base pay, overtime pay, and benefits allocated between different groups?
Is there any evidence of pay discrimination based on gender in this dataset?
How is budget allocated based on different groups and responsibilities?
Have other ideas you're curious for someone else to explore? Post them in this forum thread.

## Data Description

sf-salaries-release-*.zip (downloadable via the "Download Data" link in the header above) contains a CSV table and a SQLite database (with the same data as the CSV file). Here's the code that creates this data release.

The original source for this data is here. We've taken the raw files here and combined/normalized them into a single CSV file as well as a SQLite database with an equivalently-defined table.
